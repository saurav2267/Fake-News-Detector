# FakeNewsDetector
We live in a world of misinformation and fake news. The goal of this system is to detect fake news using Deep Learning. This is a Fake News Detection Application that helps users to detect fake news related to US politics. The data set has been scrapped from the website <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="alert-link">PolitiFact</a> and the Deep Learning Model used to build the classification model is Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM). The Frontend has been made using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap which has been rendered using the Python Flask Framework as the backend. Hope this application is useful to people.
